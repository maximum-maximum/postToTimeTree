# postToTimeTree

The GAS script for this project can automatically reflect appointments in TimeTree when they are added to Google Calendar.
If you register a private appointment in Google Calendar that you do not want to post to TimeTree, you can add the string "**private**" to the description field to prevent it from being posted to TimeTree.
